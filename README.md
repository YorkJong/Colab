### Google Colab

After discovering the usefulness of Google Colab, I ran some small programs there as practice. Some of them were interesting, so I moved them to this GitHub repository to share.

### PytorchTutorial Series

This colab notbook files of PytorchTutorial series includes the following:
* [PytorchTutorial2_Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/YorkJong/Colab/blob/3c8181e391d9f4215db19717c3473c8e4894224d/PytorchTutorial2_Regression.ipynb)
* [PytorchTutorial3_Classfication.ipynb](https://github.com/YorkJong/Colab/blob/3c8181e391d9f4215db19717c3473c8e4894224d/PytorchTutorial3_Classfication.ipynb)
* [PytorchTutorial6_min_batch.ipynb](https://github.com/YorkJong/Colab/blob/3c8181e391d9f4215db19717c3473c8e4894224d/PytorchTutorial6_min_batch.ipynb)
* [PytorchTutorial7_CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/YorkJong/Colab/blob/3c8181e391d9f4215db19717c3473c8e4894224d/PytorchTutorial7_CNN.ipynb)

I initially copied and pasted this files from [Professor Mofan's teaching website](https://juejin.cn/search?query=莫凡Pytorch教程&type=0) to colab for code verification and familiarization with PyTorch. The original example code's visualization was through Matplotlib, to better compatibility with colab, I added a Plotly version. Both are side by side, allowing for easy comparison.
