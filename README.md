The colab notebook files of the PytorchTutorial series I initially copied and pasted from Professor Mofan's teaching website to colab for code verification and familiarization with PyTorch. The original example code's visualization was through Matplotlib, to better compatibility with colab, I added a Plotly version. Both are side by side, allowing for easy comparison.
