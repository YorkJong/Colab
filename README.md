### PytorchTutorial Series

This colab notbook file of PytorchTutorial series includes the following files:
* PytorchTutorial2__Regression.ipynb
* PytorchTutorial3_Classfication.ipynb
* PytorchTutorial6_min_batch.ipynb
* PytorchTutorial7_CNN.ipynb

I initially copied and pasted this files from [Professor Mofan's teaching website](https://juejin.cn/search?query=莫凡Pytorch教程&type=0) to colab for code verification and familiarization with PyTorch. The original example code's visualization was through Matplotlib, to better compatibility with colab, I added a Plotly version. Both are side by side, allowing for easy comparison.
